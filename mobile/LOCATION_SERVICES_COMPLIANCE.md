# TailTracker Location Services Compliance

**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Platforms:** iOS App Store, Google Play Store  
**Guidelines:** Apple Location Services Guidelines, Google Play Location Permissions Policy

## Executive Summary

TailTracker uses location services for core pet safety functionality. This document ensures full compliance with platform requirements for location data collection, processing, and user consent.

## Location Usage Justification

### Core Use Cases
1. **Pet Tracking**: Real-time location monitoring for pet safety
2. **Safe Zone Monitoring**: Geofenced area alerts when pets leave designated zones
3. **Lost Pet Recovery**: Emergency location sharing and lost pet alerts
4. **Location History**: Track pet movement patterns and favorite locations
5. **Nearby Services**: Find veterinarians, pet stores, and dog parks

### Background Location Requirements
- **When Enabled**: Only when user explicitly enables pet tracking
- **User Benefit**: Continuous monitoring of pet safety zones

#### Current Implementation Status: ⚠️ REQUIRES DECLARATION

**Required Play Console Declaration:**
```
Background Location Permission Declaration

App Name: TailTracker
Permission: ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION

Primary Use Case: Pet Safety Monitoring and Lost Pet Recovery

Detailed Justification:
TailTracker uses background location access exclusively for pet safety features that provide direct user benefit:

1. Safe Zone Monitoring: Monitors when pets leave designated safe areas (home, yard, dog park) and sends immediate alerts to pet owners. This prevents pets from getting lost and enables quick recovery.

2. Lost Pet Tracking: When a pet goes missing, continuous location updates help owners track their pet's movement and coordinate with local authorities and volunteers for rescue efforts.

3. Emergency Location Sharing: In emergency situations, family members and veterinarians can access pet location information to provide immediate assistance.

4. Location History: Maintains a record of pet movements to identify patterns, favorite locations, and potential hazards in the pet's environment.

User Control and Privacy Protection:
- Background location is OPTIONAL and requires explicit user consent
- Users can disable background tracking at any time
- Location data is encrypted and stored securely
- No location data is shared with third parties except in emergencies
- Users have full control over data retention and deletion
- Clear explanation provided in app settings and onboarding

Battery and Performance Optimization:
- Intelligent location sampling reduces battery drain
- Location updates frequency adjusts based on pet movement patterns
- Background processing is optimized for minimal resource usage
- Users can adjust tracking sensitivity in app settings

Alternative Approaches Considered:
- "While Using App" location only - insufficient for pet safety monitoring
- Manual location updates - defeats the purpose of safety monitoring
- Third-party tracking devices - not accessible to all users, additional cost

This use case cannot be fulfilled without background location access as pets need continuous monitoring even when the owner is not actively using the app.
```

**Android Manifest Configuration:**
```xml
<!-- Foreground service for background location -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION" />

<!-- Location permissions with proper max SDK version -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```

## Technical Implementation Compliance

### Location Permission Request Flow

#### iOS Implementation:
```swift
// Step 1: Request "When in Use" permission
locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()

// Step 2: After user grants "When in Use", request "Always" with explanation
if CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus() == .authorizedWhenInUse {
    showBackgroundLocationEducation() // Explain why background is needed
    locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
}
```

#### Android Implementation:
```kotlin
// Step 1: Request foreground location permissions
requestPermissions([
    Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
    Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
])

// Step 2: Request background location with rationale (Android 11+)
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.R) {
    if (shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION)) {
        showBackgroundLocationRationale()
    }
    requestPermission(ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION)
}
```

### Battery Optimization Strategies

#### iOS Battery Efficiency:
```swift
// Configure location manager for efficiency
locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters
locationManager.distanceFilter = 50 // Only update every 50 meters
locationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true
locationManager.showsBackgroundLocationIndicator = true

// Use significant location changes for battery efficiency
locationManager.startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges()

// Geofencing for safe zones
locationManager.startMonitoring(for: safezone)
```

#### Android Battery Optimization:
```kotlin
// Use fused location provider for efficiency
val locationRequest = LocationRequest.Builder(
    Priority.PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY,
    30000 // Update every 30 seconds
).apply {
    setMinUpdateDistanceMeters(50f) // Only update every 50 meters
    setMaxUpdateDelayMillis(60000) // Maximum 1 minute delay
}.build()

// Foreground service for background location
class LocationService : Service() {
    override fun startForeground() {
        val notification = createNotification("Monitoring pet location")
        startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification)
    }
}
```

### Data Protection and Privacy

#### Location Data Encryption:
```typescript
// Client-side encryption before storage
const encryptLocation = (location: Location): EncryptedLocation => {
    return {
        timestamp: location.timestamp,
        coordinates: encrypt(location.coordinates, userKey),
        accuracy: location.accuracy
    };
};

// Secure transmission
const sendLocationUpdate = async (location: Location) => {
    const encrypted = encryptLocation(location);
    await secureAPI.post('/location', encrypted, {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        timeout: 10000
    });
};
```

#### Data Retention Policy:
```typescript
// Automatic location data cleanup
const cleanupLocationHistory = async () => {
    const retentionDays = user.isPremium ? 30 : 7;
    const cutoffDate = new Date();
    cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - retentionDays);
    
    await database.locations
        .where('timestamp')
        .below(cutoffDate)
        .delete();
};
```

## User Education and Consent

### Onboarding Flow:
```typescript
const LocationOnboarding: React.FC = () => (
  <View>

    </Button>
  </View>
);
```

## Emergency and Safety Features

### Emergency Location Sharing:
```typescript
const emergencyLocationShare = async (petId: string) => {
    // Share location with emergency contacts
    const location = await getCurrentLocation();
    const emergencyContacts = await getEmergencyContacts(petId);
    
    // Send SMS with location link
    for (const contact of emergencyContacts) {
        await sendSMS(contact.phone, 
            `EMERGENCY: ${pet.name} needs help. Location: ${location.mapLink}`
        );
    }
    
    // Notify local authorities if configured
    if (pet.emergencyServices) {
        await notifyEmergencyServices(pet, location);
    }
};
```

### Lost Pet Alert System:
```typescript
const activateLostPetMode = async (petId: string) => {
    // Increase location update frequency
    await setLocationUpdateInterval(5000); // Every 5 seconds
    
    // Enable high accuracy mode
    await setLocationAccuracy('high');
    
    // Broadcast to pet recovery network
    await broadcastLostPetAlert({
        pet: pet,
        lastKnownLocation: location,
        ownerContact: user.phone
    });
    
    // Create geofence around last known location
    await createSearchGeofence(location, 5000); // 5km radius
};
```
