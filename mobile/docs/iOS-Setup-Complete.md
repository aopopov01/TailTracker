## Next Steps for macOS Development

Since the iOS project generation was completed on Linux, the following steps need to be performed on a macOS machine:

### 1. Install CocoaPods Dependencies
```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

### 2. Open in Xcode
```bash
open TailTracker.xcworkspace
```

### 3. Configure Signing & Provisioning
1. Select TailTracker target
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Set your Team ID
4. Configure provisioning profiles for:
   - Development
   - App Store distribution

### 4. Update Production Settings
The following placeholders need to be updated with actual values:

#### EAS Configuration (`eas.json`)
- `ascApiKeyId`: Your App Store Connect API Key ID
- `ascApiKeyIssuerId`: Your App Store Connect Issuer ID
- `ascAppId`: Your App Store Connect App ID

#### Environment Configuration
Create `.env` file with:
```
ASC_API_KEY_ID=your_api_key_id_here
ASC_API_ISSUER_ID=your_issuer_id_here
ASC_APP_ID=your_app_store_connect_app_id
```

### 5. Add App Store Connect API Key
Place your `AuthKey.p8` file in the `ios/` directory for automated submissions.

## Build Commands Available

The project includes comprehensive build scripts:

### Development Build
```bash
./scripts/build-ios.sh
```

### Production Build
```bash
./scripts/build-ios.sh -t production
```

### Simulator Build
```bash
./scripts/build-ios.sh -t simulator
```

### TestFlight Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy-ios.sh -t testflight
```

### App Store Submission
```bash
./scripts/deploy-ios.sh -t appstore
```

## EAS Build Profiles

The project is configured with multiple EAS build profiles:

- **development**: Debug builds with development client
- **preview**: Internal testing builds
- **simulator**: iOS Simulator builds
- **testflight**: TestFlight distribution
- **production**: App Store production builds

## Asset Requirements

Placeholder assets have been created. For production, replace with:

### App Icons (Required)
- 1024x1024 App Store icon
- Various sizes for different devices
- Location: `ios/TailTracker/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

- App category: Utilities/Lifestyle
- Content rating: 4+ (suitable for all ages)

## Testing Recommendations

### Before App Store Submission
1. **Device Testing**: Test on multiple iOS devices and versions
2. **Permission Flow**: Verify all permission requests work correctly
3. **Background Tasks**: Test location tracking and notifications
4. **In-App Purchases**: Verify purchase flows work correctly
5. **Performance**: Check memory usage and battery impact
6. **Accessibility**: Test with VoiceOver and other accessibility features

### TestFlight Testing
1. Internal team testing first
2. External beta testing with limited users
3. Collect feedback and iterate
4. Monitor crash reports and performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clean and reset
./scripts/build-ios.sh -c
cd ios && pod install
```

#### Signing Issues
- Verify Apple Developer account membership
- Check provisioning profile validity
- Ensure certificates are not expired

#### Push Notification Issues
- Verify APNs certificates
- Check entitlements configuration
- Test in both development and production environments
