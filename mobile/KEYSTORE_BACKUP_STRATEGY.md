# TailTracker Android Keystore Backup Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the critical backup and security strategy for the TailTracker Android app production keystore. **Loss of the production keystore means you cannot update your app on Google Play Store.**

## Critical Files to Backup

### 1. Production Keystore
- **File**: `android/app/tailtracker-release.keystore`
- **Description**: The actual keystore file used to sign release builds
- **Critical Level**: MAXIMUM - Cannot be regenerated if lost

### 2. Keystore Configuration
- **File**: `keystore.properties`
- **Description**: Contains passwords and configuration for the keystore
- **Critical Level**: HIGH - Contains sensitive authentication data

### 3. Certificate Information
- **Alias**: `tailtracker-release`
- **Algorithm**: RSA 2048-bit
- **Validity**: 30000 days (~82 years)
- **Distinguished Name**: CN=TailTracker,OU=Mobile Development,O=TailTracker LLC,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US

## Backup Locations

### Primary Backup (Required)
1. **Encrypted Cloud Storage**
   - Use services like AWS S3 with encryption, Google Drive with encryption, or similar
   - Create a separate encrypted folder specifically for keystores
   - Upload both the keystore file and properties file

### Secondary Backup (Recommended)
2. **Physical Secure Storage**
   - USB drive stored in a safe or bank safety deposit box
   - Include printed copies of keystore information
   - Update whenever keystore changes

### Team Backup (For Organizations)
3. **Secure Team Sharing**
   - Use enterprise password managers (1Password, Bitwarden Business, etc.)
   - Share keystore files through encrypted enterprise file sharing
   - Ensure multiple authorized team members have access

## Backup Procedures

### Initial Backup Setup
```bash
# Create encrypted backup directory
mkdir -p ~/keystores-backup

# Copy keystore files
cp android/app/tailtracker-release.keystore ~/keystores-backup/
cp keystore.properties ~/keystores-backup/

# Create backup info file
cat > ~/keystores-backup/keystore-info.txt << EOF
TailTracker Android Keystore Backup
Created: $(date)
Keystore: tailtracker-release.keystore
Alias: tailtracker-release
Validity: Until $(date -d '+30000 days')
EOF

# Encrypt the backup directory (optional but recommended)
tar -czf tailtracker-keystores-backup.tar.gz ~/keystores-backup/
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 tailtracker-keystores-backup.tar.gz
```

### Regular Backup Verification
- **Frequency**: Every 3 months
- **Process**: Verify backup files can be accessed and are not corrupted
- **Test**: Attempt to list keystore contents using backed up files

### Backup Verification Command
```bash
# Verify keystore integrity
keytool -list -v -keystore tailtracker-release.keystore -storepass [STORE_PASSWORD]
```

## Access Control

### Who Should Have Access
1. **Primary Developer/DevOps Lead** - Full access to keystore and passwords
2. **Project Manager/Technical Lead** - Access to secure backup locations
3. **CTO/Technical Director** - Emergency access to all backup locations

### Access Logging
- Document who has access to keystore files
- Log when keystore is accessed or backed up
- Review access permissions quarterly

## Security Best Practices

### Storage Security
- **Never** store keystores in plain text in repositories
- **Never** share keystores through unsecured channels (email, Slack, etc.)
- **Always** use encrypted storage for backups
- **Always** use strong, unique passwords for keystores

### Password Management
- Store keystore passwords in enterprise password manager
- Use different passwords for store and key if possible
- Rotate passwords annually (requires generating new keystore)
- Use environment variables for CI/CD, never hardcode passwords

### Team Security
- Limit keystore access to essential personnel only
- Use principle of least privilege
- Require two-person approval for keystore changes
- Conduct security reviews of keystore access quarterly

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### If Keystore is Lost
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Check all backup locations immediately
   - Attempt recovery from team members' secure storage
   - Contact Google Play Developer support

2. **If Keystore Cannot be Recovered**
   - **Critical**: You cannot update the existing app
   - Must publish a new app with a new package name
   - All existing users will need to download the new app
   - Lose all app reviews, ratings, and download statistics

### Recovery Testing
- **Quarterly**: Test keystore recovery from backups
- **Annually**: Conduct full disaster recovery simulation
- Document recovery time and any issues found

## Google Play App Signing (Recommended)

### Benefits
- Google manages the signing key for distribution
- You only need to maintain the upload key
- Can recover from upload key loss (with verification)
- Enhanced security through Google's infrastructure

### Migration Steps
1. Enroll in Google Play App Signing in Play Console
2. Upload your existing keystore as the upload key
3. Google generates and manages the app signing key
4. Continue using your upload key for new releases

## Compliance and Auditing

### Annual Security Audit
- Review all backup locations and access
- Verify backup integrity and accessibility
- Update backup procedures as needed
- Document any security incidents or near-misses

### Compliance Requirements
- Follow organizational security policies
- Meet any industry-specific requirements (HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
- Maintain audit trails for keystore access
- Regular security training for team members with access

## Emergency Contacts

### Internal Contacts
- Technical Lead: [Add contact information]
- DevOps Manager: [Add contact information]
- Security Officer: [Add contact information]

### External Contacts

## Conclusion

The production keystore is one of the most critical assets for the TailTracker Android app. Proper backup and security procedures are essential to ensure business continuity and avoid catastrophic scenarios that could prevent app updates.

**Remember**: It's better to be overly cautious with keystore security than to risk losing the ability to update your app.
