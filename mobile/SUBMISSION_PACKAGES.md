Notes: This demo account has sample pets configured with location tracking enabled. Please ensure location permissions are granted for full feature testing.

Review Notes:
TailTracker uses location services for pet tracking and safety monitoring. The app requests background location permission to monitor safe zones and send alerts when pets leave designated areas. All location usage is clearly explained to users and can be disabled in settings.

The app includes in-app purchases for premium subscriptions (€7.99/month, €79.99/year) with a 7-day free trial. All subscription terms are clearly disclosed and managed through Apple's standard subscription system.

Please test the following key features:
1. Pet profile creation with photo upload
2. Location tracking and safe zone setup  
3. Premium subscription flow
4. Family sharing functionality
5. Accessibility features with VoiceOver
```

### 3. Data Safety Declaration

#### Complete Data Safety Form
```json
{
  "dataCollectionAndSecurity": {
    "dataCollected": true,
    "dataShared": true,
    "dataEncryptedInTransit": true,
    "dataDeletionRequests": true,
    "privacyPolicyUrl": "https://tailtracker.com/privacy"
  },
  "dataTypes": {
    "personalInfo": {
      "name": {
        "collected": true,
        "shared": false,
        "purposes": ["App functionality"],
        "optional": false
      },

        "purposes": ["App functionality"],

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Sensitive Permissions Declaration

#### Background Location Declaration
```
Permission: ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION

Core Use Case: Pet Safety and Location Monitoring

Detailed Description:
TailTracker uses background location access exclusively for pet safety monitoring. When users enable pet tracking, the app monitors pet locations to:

1. Send alerts when pets leave designated safe zones
2. Provide location updates for lost pet recovery
3. Maintain location history for pet behavior analysis
4. Enable emergency location sharing with family members

The app implements the following user protections:
- Explicit user consent required before accessing background location
- Clear explanation of why background location is needed
- Option to disable background tracking at any time
- Automatic data deletion after 30 days (Premium) or 7 days (Free)
- Battery-optimized location sampling to minimize power consumption

Alternative options considered:
- "While using app" location only: Insufficient for safety monitoring when app is closed
- Manual location updates: Defeats the purpose of continuous safety monitoring
- Third-party devices: Additional cost and complexity for users

Background location access is essential for the core value proposition of pet safety and cannot be fulfilled through alternative approaches.
