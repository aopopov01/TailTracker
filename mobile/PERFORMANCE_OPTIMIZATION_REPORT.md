const performanceMonitor = usePerformanceMonitor();

// Track critical user journeys
performanceMonitor.startTiming('pet_onboarding_flow');
// ... user actions
performanceMonitor.endTiming('pet_onboarding_flow', 'user_journey', {
  success: true,

});
```

## Bundle Size Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Dependency Audit
```bash
# Analyze bundle composition
npx react-native-bundle-visualizer

# Remove unused dependencies
npm uninstall unused-package-1 unused-package-2

# Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives
npm uninstall moment && npm install date-fns  # 67KB → 13KB
```

### 2. Code Splitting Implementation
```typescript
// Lazy load screens
const PetProfileScreen = React.lazy(() => import('./PetProfileScreen'));
const PaymentScreen = React.lazy(() => import('./PaymentScreen'));

// Use dynamic imports for heavy utilities
const processImage = async () => {
  const { ImageProcessor } = await import('../utils/ImageProcessor');
  return new ImageProcessor();
};
```

### 3. Asset Optimization
```bash
# Optimize images
npm install --save-dev imagemin imagemin-pngquant imagemin-mozjpeg

# Configure webpack for asset optimization
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'imagemin-webpack-loader',
            options: {
              pngquant: { quality: [0.65, 0.9] },
              mozjpeg: { progressive: true, quality: 80 }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing Strategy
1. **Load Testing**: Test with 1000+ pet records
2. **Memory Testing**: Monitor for memory leaks over 24-hour usage
3. **Battery Testing**: Measure battery drain over typical usage patterns
4. **Network Testing**: Validate performance under 2G, 3G, 4G, and WiFi
5. **Device Testing**: Test on low-end, mid-range, and high-end devices

### Automated Performance Tests
```typescript
// Jest performance tests
describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  test('Pet list renders under 16ms', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    render(<PetList pets={mockPets} />);
    const renderTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(renderTime).toBeLessThan(16); // 60 FPS target
  });

  test('Image loading completes under 1 second', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await loadOptimizedImage('test-image.jpg');
    const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(1000);
  });
