# TailTracker Design System

A state-of-the-art, emotionally engaging design system that creates instant emotional connections between pet owners and their beloved companions.

## Philosophy
TailTracker isn't just an app - it's a bridge between pet parents and their furry family members. Our design system is built on three core principles:

1. **Emotional Connection**: Every interaction should strengthen the bond between pets and their humans
2. **Intuitive Simplicity**: Complex features feel effortless through thoughtful UX
3. **Premium Experience**: Free users get a taste of luxury, premium users get the full feast

## 🎨 What's New - Magic UI Integration

We've integrated **Magic UI** components adapted for React Native, bringing modern web animations to mobile:

### ✨ Magic UI Components

</AnimatedButton>

// Text reveal for hero content
<TextReveal animationType="slideUp">
  Welcome to TailTracker
</TextReveal>
