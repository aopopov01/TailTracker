## 🌐 Cross-Platform Consistency Test Cases

### iOS/Android Feature Parity Testing

#### TC-500: Navigation and UI Consistency
**Priority**: High | **Type**: Functional | **Automation**: Yes
```
Test Case ID: TC-500
Title: Cross-Platform Navigation and User Interface Consistency  
Preconditions:
- TailTracker installed on both iOS and Android devices
- Same user account logged in on both platforms
- Data synchronized between platforms
- Latest app versions installed

Platform-Specific Behavior Validation:

1. Navigation Pattern Consistency
iOS Specific Elements:
- Navigation bar with back button (< chevron)
- Swipe-to-go-back gesture support
- Tab bar at bottom with iOS design language
- Modal presentation from bottom
- Pull-to-refresh with iOS styling

Android Specific Elements:  
- Action bar with back arrow
- Hardware/software back button support
- Material Design navigation patterns
- Floating action buttons where appropriate
- Swipe refresh with Material Design styling

Test Steps:
1. Navigate through identical user flows on both platforms
2. Compare visual consistency and brand alignment  
3. Test platform-specific interaction patterns
4. Verify feature accessibility on both platforms
5. Compare performance and responsiveness

Expected Consistency:
- Core functionality identical on both platforms
- Visual design adapted to platform conventions
- Information architecture exactly matching
- User flow logic consistent across platforms
- Feature availability parity maintained

```typescript
describe('Cross-Platform Consistency', () => {
  const platforms = ['ios', 'android'];
  
  platforms.forEach(platform => {
    describe(`${platform.toUpperCase()} Platform`, () => {
      beforeAll(async () => {
        await device.selectApp(platform);
        await device.launchApp();
      });

      test('navigation patterns follow platform conventions', async () => {
        // Test navigation flow
        await element(by.id('pets-tab')).tap();
        await element(by.id('pet-card')).atIndex(0).tap();
        
        if (platform === 'ios') {
          // Test iOS back navigation
          await expect(element(by.id('nav-back-button'))).toBeVisible();
          await element(by.id('nav-back-button')).tap();
          
          // Test swipe back gesture
          await element(by.id('pet-card')).atIndex(0).tap();
          await element(by.id('main-content')).swipe('right', 'fast');
          
        } else if (platform === 'android') {
          // Test Android back button
          await device.pressBack();
          await expect(element(by.id('pets-list'))).toBeVisible();
          
          // Test hardware back navigation  
          await element(by.id('pet-card')).atIndex(0).tap();
          await device.pressBack();
        }
        
        await expect(element(by.id('pets-list'))).toBeVisible();
      });

      test('feature parity maintained across platforms', async () => {
        const features = [
          'add-pet',
          'vaccination-tracking', 
          'lost-pet-alerts',
          'family-sharing',
          'premium-upgrade',
          'photo-upload'
        ];

        for (const feature of features) {
          await expect(element(by.id(feature))).toBeVisible();
        }
      });
    });
  });

  test('data synchronization works across platforms', async () => {
    // Create pet on iOS
    await device.selectApp('ios');
    const testPet = {
      name: 'CrossPlatformTest',
      species: 'Dog',
      breed: 'Test Breed'
    };
    
    await createPet(testPet);
    
    // Wait for sync
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
    
    // Verify pet appears on Android
    await device.selectApp('android');
    await element(by.id('pets-tab')).tap();
    await expect(element(by.text(testPet.name))).toBeVisible();
    
    // Verify data consistency
    await element(by.text(testPet.name)).tap();
    await expect(element(by.text(testPet.breed))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

2. Push Notification Consistency
Test Scenarios:
- Vaccination reminders delivered identically
- Lost pet alerts formatted consistently  
- Premium feature notifications aligned
- System integration (notification channels, etc.)
- User preference synchronization

3. Payment Processing Parity
Validation Points:
- Subscription plans identically priced
- Payment flows consistent user experience
- Receipt handling matches across platforms
- Family sharing billing works identically
- Cancellation process maintains parity

Pass Criteria:
✓ Core features 100% functionally identical
✓ Platform-specific UI follows design guidelines
✓ Navigation patterns feel native to each platform
✓ Data synchronization maintains consistency
✓ Performance characteristics comparable
✓ No platform-exclusive features without justification
